SUPERMARKET TRANSACTIONS SUMMARY

What was asked?
This analysis addressed three business questions using three years of supermarket
transaction data:
1. The total quantity of apples purchased using cash.
2. The total cash amount spent on apples.
3. The total amount spent by non-member customers at the Bakershire store location.

What was found:
- Total apples purchased using cash: 117
- Total cash spent on apples: $537.03
- Total spend by non-member customers at Bakershire: $2857.51

Notably, the analysis required a correction from 'apples' to 'apple' to
align with the dataset's naming convention. The results above reflect the
accurate aggregation of all cash-based apple transactions.

Why the results are credible:
- Data was cleaned and standardized (case-insensitivity and whitespace removal).
- Product naming was verified against the unique product registry.
- Results were validated using reproducible, deterministic logic.
- No assumptions were introduced beyond what is present in the dataset.

This file, together with the cleaned dataset, represents the final graded deliverable.
